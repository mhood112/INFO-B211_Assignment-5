mhood112: Use the built-in breast cancer dataset from Scikit Learn and build 3 different machine learning classification models. Use the standard data division process described in the Machine Learning lecture to train and evaluate your models performance.



GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example of how you can use the built-in breast cancer dataset from Scikit Learn to build three different machine learning classification models. We'll use Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. We'll also follow the standard data division process to train and evaluate the models.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load the breast cancer dataset
data = load_breast_cancer()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Initialize the models
log_reg = LogisticRegression(random_state=42)
decision_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)
svm = SVC(random_state=42)

# Train the models
log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
decision_tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
svm.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred_log_reg = log_reg.predict(X_test)
y_pred_decision_tree = decision_tree.predict(X_test)
y_pred_svm = svm.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the models
print("Logistic Regression:")
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_log_reg)}")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_log_reg))

print("Decision Tree:")
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_decision_tree)}")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_decision_tree))

print("Support Vector Machine:")
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_svm)}")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred_svm))
```

This code will load the breast cancer dataset, split it into training and testing sets, standardize the data, train three different classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM), and then evaluate their performance using accuracy and classification reports.
